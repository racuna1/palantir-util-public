"""
anonymize.py: removes identifying information from a roster, Canvas gradebook, and associated submission
                          Gradescope metadata.

The anonymized data is intended to be in a format as close to the original as possible but with entries for
"Student, Test" and staff removed.

Transformations:
* Data is filtered based on a consent form.
* Staff are implicitly removed since they did not submit a consent form and therefore have not consented.
* Remove "Student, Test" if present in the data. (Separate from above due to missing sid.)

The following Canvas gradebook columns will be masked: Student, ID, SIS User ID, SIS Login ID. The SIS Login ID will be
populated with a random four-digit number, and the order of the rows randomized. In the Gradescope export, the following
fields will be masked: name, sid, email. The sid will be replaced with the same random numbers used to mask the Canvas
gradebook.

Unsupported data:
* Gradescope Short Answer Submissions
* Gradescope Programming Source Code (final only)
